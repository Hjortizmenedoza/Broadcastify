BREAKING: Saudi Arabia üá∏üá¶ is set to become the world's largest AI investor with a new $40 billion fund ü§Ø

The fund, powered by the Saudi government, will invest in AI start-ups and the related technology necessary to power the AI revolution, including chips and data centers. 

The Middle East is poised to be the key global financier for the next big AI companies. 

Semi-conductor chips have been called the new oil, but the Middle East has a lot of oil, and a lot of cash from said oil profits. 

With Aramco generating ~$400 billion in profits over the last three years alone, Saudi Arabia is now looking to deploy those riches into AI and tech. 

This is a staggering move that could have a major impact on the future of technology.
